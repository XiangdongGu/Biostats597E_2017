## SAS Programmer In Pharmaceutical Industry

What is a SAS programmer's daily work in pharmaceutical industry?
**Tables, Listings, Figures** (Mostly tables)

## Example Deliverable Table

## How the Table is Generated

- Gather data from different sources necessary to produce the table
- Data transformation and joining into a table ready to produce the report (SQL is very useful in this step)
- Create the report in a format as specified using **PROC REPORT**

## Example 1: Prep Data For Demo Table

## Create Overall Group

We can duplicate the original data and assign treatment group to "Overall" so we obtain overall statistics when we do **group by**.

```
create table demo1 as
    select * from demo
    UNION ALL
    select subjid, 'Overall' as trt, gender, race, age from demo;
```

## Summary by Age

```
select trt,  'age' as variable, 'N' as category, 
  count(age) as value from demo1 group by trt
UNION ALL
select trt,  'age' as variable, 'Mean' as category, 
  round(avg(age), 1) as value from demo1 group by trt
UNION ALL
select trt,  'age' as variable, 'Minimum' as category, 
  min(age) as value from demo1 group by trt
UNION ALL
select trt,  'age' as variable, 'Maximum' as category, 
  max(age) as value from demo1 group by trt
```

## Summary by Gender

```
select trt,  'gender' as variable, gender as category, count(*) as value
  from demo1
group by trt, variable, category
having category is not null
```

## Summary by Race

```
select trt, 'race' as variable, race as category, count(*) as value
  from demo1
group by trt, variable, category
```

## Combine Them
We combine the queries into one and create a temp table
```
Create table demo_sum as
...
```

## Transpose Table
SAS **PROC TRANSPOSE** might be a better way, but we can still do in SQL.

```
select t1.*, Placebo, Overall from
  (select variable, category, value as Active
    from demo_sum where trt = 'ACTIVE') t1 inner join
  (select variable, category, value as Placebo 
    from demo_sum where trt = 'PLACEBO') t2 
    on t1.variable = t2.variable and t1.category = t2.category inner join
  (select variable, category, value as Overall 
    from demo_sum where trt = 'Overall') t3 
  on t1.variable = t3.variable and t1.category = t3.category
```

The result table should be ready to produce well formated report

## Excersise
In **temp** table, find days with rising temperature (temperature higher than its previous day)

## Excersise
In **salary** table, for each department find highest 3 salaried employees
